# Galaxy Imaging on Moolight Night

As you know, the moonlight reflects the spectrum of the sun. The following site shows the spectrum of the moon.

If the spectrum of light pollution was identical to that of the light source, it would be difficult to avoid the effects of moonlight even with red to near-infrared filters, because on a moonlit night, the light source is similar to the spectrum of a galaxy, which is a large group of stars like the Sun.

However, due to Rayleigh scattering, the glow from moonlight is also expected to be significantly less in the red to near-infrared as in the blue sky during the daytime.

Therefore, even on a moonlit night, red to near-infrared imaging of galaxies can be expected to be effective.
